# SillySong
A Udacity project from Beginning iOS Development Nanodegree

This was the final project of the Beginning iOS Development Nanodegree. The purpose is to showcase making an app from scratch,
including the UI elements and all of the methods. The app takes a person's name and puts it into a silly rhyme that
most people are familiar with.
